# Quaternary Plate - Prototype 1

![devlog](https://github.com/jilleJr/Quaternary-Plate/blob/prototype-01/Devlog/starting_to_look_like_something.gif)

This prototype tries with a grid-style of builder.

Idea is to have the core of the ship in the middle, and then allow the player to build their ship as they please.

Inspiration for this building technique is mainly from Captain Forever and StarMade.
